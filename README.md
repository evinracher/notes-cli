This project is based on introduction to Node.js course from frontend masters.

It contains some examples of how to create files, read and write them. And a basic server. I also contains a CLI to add notes using your terminal and to see those in the browser. It was built using yargs, and open package, to open the browser whenever you add a new note. Also it contains basic test using jest.
